<h2>Danger!</h2>
<br>
<br>
Yeah, you could go to a normal place and relax.... Or you could
<br>
come here, where you will be endlessly thrown in to life
<br>
or death threatening situations!
<br>
<br>
No need to be eased in gently, just walk right up to a herd of
<br>
mammoths, they probably won't hurt you! Don't worry about
<br>
those giants guarding them I doubt they hit very hard anyway.
<br>
Did I also mention we have highly aggressive dragons that 
<br>
will attack you as you were to transverse the place? Cool as, right?

<div class="nature-paragraph">
<h2>Nature!</h2>
<br>
<br>
Do you like nature? Great! As you walk around Skyrim you will
<br>
quickly learn that nature here doesn't like you
<br>
<br>
Discover what they mean by 'harsh environment' as you
<br>
gleefully freeze in our snowy, cold region
<br>
<br>
Do you like spiders? Great! We have GIANT ones that will
<br>
totally take you on in a fight. You won't even need to ask
<br>
them, they will just run right up to you! How cool is that?!
